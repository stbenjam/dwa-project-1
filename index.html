                <h1>Stephen Benjamin</h1>

                <p>I'm an ALM candidate at the Extension school. I'm currently
                taking CSCI E-15, CSCI E-55, and CSCI E-48. Iâ€™m also a TA for
                CSCI E-93.</p>

                <p>I grew up in the Boston area but moved away after high
                school. I spent some time in the Navy (former CTI2), and then
                lived in various places like California, Atlanta, and Germany.
                I moved back here a couple of years ago. I'm into hiking,
                cycling, and I also play ice hockey in the winter (quite
                poorly).</p>

                <p>I've been a software developer and a systems administrator
                for a number of years. I'm currently employed by Red Hat, but
                on a leave of absence while I finish the last few requirements for my
                Master's degree.</p>
